					<h1 id="moves"><span class="sectionCollapse"></span>Universal Moves</h1>
					<p>Unlike other fighting games, Among Us Arena only truly has one character: the Impostor. As such, all characters' non-Sus/EX moves are completely identical.</p>
					<h3 id="inpLight">Light</h3>
					<p>Light acts as your quick, weak option with short range. Useful for combo starters, short range disruptions, and as a panic option.</p>
					<span class="moveInput"><img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png"><span class="attackL">L</span></span>
					<div class="contentSegment">
						<ul class="movelistList">
							<li>Fast, literal poke that starts combos.</li>
							<li>Yummers</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<span class="moveInput"><img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_2.png"><span class="attackL">L</span></span>
					<div class="contentSegment">
						<ul class="movelistList">
							<li>Your fastest low, and starts combos just as well.</li>
							<li>Slides you forward a short distance.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<span class="moveInput"><img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png"><span class="attackL">L (Air)</span></span>
					<div class="contentSegment">
						<ul class="movelistList">
							<li>Fast and good for approaching from the air.</li>
							<li>The Impostor's massive ass gives this move more backwards range.</li>
							<li>The famous "sex kick".</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<h3 id="inpHeavy">Heavy</h3>
					<p>Heavy works well for combos, as well as to launch your opponent. Tends to be slow but more rewarding than Light.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">H
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A forward punch that trades off speed for range, making it useful for starting combos and a bit of utility in continuing combos as well.</li>
							<li>Slides you forward a short distance.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_2.png">H
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A low punch that reaches far and launches your opponent across the stage. Can be a combo starter at certain ranges, but more useful as a low poke.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">H (Air)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Launches the opponent directly down, bouncing them off the ground and letting this move be a highly effective combo tool.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="inpKnife">Knife</h2>
					<p>Knife is your slower but more disjointed poke and combo tool. Good if you're British.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">K
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A downwards knife stab that can start combos if you land it.</li>
							<li>Can be charged if the button is held down. The charged versions have more damage, as well as becoming an overhead.</li>
							<li>Has one hit of armor during the move.</li>
							<li>When hitting an oppoent that's in the air, it will immediately send them to the ground. Doesn't combo but puts you at an advantage.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_2.png">K
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>An upwards knife swing. Very scary, as it's one of your best combo tools, anti-airs, and exceptional at starting combos if you can land it as well.</li>
							<li>Slides you forward, giving it a large range.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">K (Air)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A burst movement option that rushes you forward. Good for combos and cross-ups.</li>
							<li>Holding <img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_4.png"> during the move will shorten the distance you travel.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="inpGun">Gun</h2>
					<p>Gun acts as a combo and zoning tool. Good if you're American.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">G
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Fullscreen projectile that hits with the gun first, then the shot. Primarily useful for zoning, but has some combo application.</li>
							<li>The shot itself cannot hit airborne opponents outside of combos.</li>
							<li>The shot can be delayed if the button is held down. Gets more powerful if delayed as long as possible.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_2.png">G
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>An upwards gunshot that acts as a larger but slower anti-air. Also useful as a combo tool.</li>
							<li>The shot itself cannot hit grounded opponents at all.</li>
							<li>The shot can be delayed if the button is held down. Gets more powerful if delayed as long as possible.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">G (Air)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Very useful for zoning in the air, helped by a recoil effect that pushes you back when the shot is fired.</li>
							<li>The shot can be delayed if the button is held down. Gets more powerful if delayed as long as possible.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="inpSus">Sus</h2>
					<p>Sus is your character's unique action that defines their playstyle.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_2.png">S
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Performs a parry. If an opponent hits you at the start of the move, you will automatically counterattack.</li>
							<li>The counterattack tracks your opponent's position, allowing it to beat cross-ups and longer ranged moves.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_6.png">S/<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_4.png">S
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Performs a throw when close to an opponent. Cannot be comboed out of, but puts you at a significant advantage.</li>
							<li><img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_6.png">S will throw the opponent in front of you, while <img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_4.png">S will throw the opponent behind you.</li>
							<li>Throws cannot be performed in the air.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							<img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_5.png">S (Air)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Performs your character's unique Sus move in the air. See <a href="#characters">Characters</a> for more detailed information on what each one does.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="inpDash">Dash</h2>
					<p>Dash exists solely as way to more easily perform forward/backward dashes, rather than hitting forward or backward twice.</p>
					<h2 id="inpEX">EX Move</h2>
					<p>EX Move is your character's unique, powered-up action. They can also be performed by inputting Light or Heavy + Sus, however this can be disabled per player in the controls options.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>See <a href="#characters">Characters</a> for more detailed information on what each one does.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="inpSuper">Super</h2>
					<p>Super will trigger whatever super you selected before the match. They can also be performed by inputting Knife or Gun + Sus, however this can be disabled per player in the controls options.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Super 1 (Right Hand Man's Beam Super)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Costs 4 bars of meter.</li>
							<li>High damage, fullscreen, and can be comboed into. Allows you to end a combo with a large amount of damage.</li>
							<li>Additionally has invinvibility on startup, meaning it can be used as a reversal.</li>
							<li>Fires diagonally downwards at a sharp angle when used in the air.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							Super 2 (Sabotage Install)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Costs 2 bars of meter. If this super is used with 3 or 4 bars of meter available, it will consume the additional bars to extend the duration of the install.</li>
							<li>Allows you to enter a state where you deal more damage, your combos can last longer, and your opponent cannot burst.</li>
							<li>The duration of the install is indicated by an outline around your healthbar area.</li>
							<li>Can be used in the middle of a combo.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							Super 3 (Megaphone Report)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Costs 2 bars of meter.</li>
							<li>Sends out a large shockwave that, if it hits your opponent, will cause them to be launched back with a large slowdown effect.</li>
							<li>Can be used during any move, and cancels out of the rest of the move, allowing you to extend a combo further or safely get out of the commitment of a risky move.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="inpTaunt">Taunt</h2>
					<p>Taunt performs a funny little move. Usually has little actual practicality.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Most taunts give you a very tiny amount of meter on use.</li>
						<li>Taunts can also be performed by rapidly hitting <img class="inputImage" src="../../img/inputs/input_2.png"> 3 times.</li>
