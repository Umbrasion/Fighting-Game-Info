						<p class="boxTop boxBottom">So you wanna get into fighting games. But how should you start? <i>Where</i> should you start? How do you even go about understanding the game and getting better at it? That's what this page is here to explain.</p>

					<h3 id="q1"><span class="sectionCollapse"></span>How do I find a game I like?</h3>
					<div class="contentSegment">
						<p class="boxTop boxBottom">There's a lot of different styles of fighting gamesâ€”from traditional to platform fighters, ground-focused to airdashers, slow-paced to fast-paced, and so on. But it can be hard to really know what you enjoy most, so the best thing to do is <b>give different fighting games a shot!</b> If you end up not liking it or prefer certain aspects then that's okay, and it narrows down your search for the kind that you would like to try.</p>
					</div>
					<!---->
					<h3 id="q2"><span class="sectionCollapse"></span>What character should I play?</h3>
					<div class="contentSegment">
						<p class="boxTop"><b>Play whoever you want!</b> Every game has many different characters, and whatever character works for you is the one you should go with. Pick who you have fun with the most and that you won't quickly get tired of playing.</p>
						<p class="boxBottom">While pretty much every fighting game has characters that are more "beginner-friendly," you don't have to pick them first. Beginner characters don't always teach you everything, and they could play very differently from the character you have your eyes on. They can be helpful in some ways, but ultimately choosing who you like is most important.</p>
					</div>
					<!---->
					<h3 id="q3"><span class="sectionCollapse"></span>Should I care about tier placements?</h3>
					<div class="contentSegment">
						<p class="boxTop">In short: <b>No.</b></p>
						<p>If you're starting out in a fighting game, characters that are good and characters that are bad are wildly different. A character that does a lot of damage or has long range can be considered a good character at low level since you're unlikely to know how to deal with those, or a character with a higher skill floor can be considered a bad character at low level since you'd be less knowledgable with how to properly utilize them.</p>
						<p class="boxBottom">As such, concerning yourself with tier lists for serious purposes isn't something I would recommend. Of course, there's nothing wrong with doing so, and potentially you're someone who would rather a good character with a lot of options, or someone who wants to push a worse character as far as they can go. But tiers aren't every part of a game, and in most fighting games, a "low tier" character doesn't mean they have no chance of winning, they're still a viable character that you can play and do well with.</p>
